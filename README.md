This program displays an assortment of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS character classes based on two inputs.
Users can enter their birthday and have a class displayed based on their zodiac.
Alternatively, users can click a series of buttons to change the class displayed.

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and all artwork herein (though all modified by me) are property of Wizards of the Coast.

Potential extra credit worthy additions:
1. Use of modals to build one-page experience with landing screen and changing layout for improved UX.
2. Wiggle animation on character button hover (first tilt left, then tilt right, for naturalistic shake).
3. Character fade-in on each character switch.
4. RESETTING screen fade-in on each page switch without reload necessary.
5. Character class title glow that changes color depending on result.
6. Use of flexbox.
7. Added functionality and affordance to show currently selected character from the list of buttons.
8. Each character button has a uniquely colored background glow, and the glow changes on hover so the rune lights up inside.
9. Researched and implemented the fuzzy translucent text background just for this project, and I'm really proud of how it looks.
